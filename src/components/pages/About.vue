        <h2>Gaynor (Vocals & Guitar)</h2>
        <div style="font-family: ariel; font-size: 1.2em;">
        <p>Music has always been a huge part of my life. From listening to The Eagles in the back of Dad’s car to dancing around the living room to Cliff Richard with my Mum to singing along to Charley Pride with my Nan, my world has been filled with music for as long as I can remember.</p>
        <p>As a young girl, I would go with my family to the local country music club every week to watch live bands and it was here my dream to perform was born.</p>
        <p>I started singing and playing guitar at 11 and went on to perform solo and in various bands. </p>
        <p>Finally, in 2018 I joined a Country Rock band. This introduced me to some amazing musicians, sharing the same love of country music as me, 2 of whom remain in the band we have today.</p>
        <p>We have been incredibly fortunate to meet more talented and likeminded musicians with a real passion for country music along the way and from this, have been lucky enough to form Boss & The Hogs.</p>
        <p>I couldn’t be prouder of this band and the strength of our friendships. I can finally say my lifelong dream has come true - living proof you should never give up on your dream. But most importantly, I now get the chance to channel my inner ‘Dolly’ which is pretty damn amazing!!</p>
